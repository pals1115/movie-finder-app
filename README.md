DESCRIPTION: The Movie Finder is a responsive and interactive ReactJS-based web application that allows users to search for movies and explore detailed information including the title, year of release, poster, and more ‚Äî all fetched in real time using the OMDb API. It also allows users to save their favorite movies, making it a simple yet practical movie browsing experience.

This project was developed as part of a hands-on learning module in ReactJS, designed to enhance practical skills in API integration, component-based architecture, state management, conditional rendering, and user-friendly design. The app demonstrates how to fetch and display external data, update UI dynamically, and handle user interactions effectively.

üéØ Project Objective
The primary objective of the Movie Finder app was to:

Build a ReactJS application that integrates with a public API

Learn to handle asynchronous API calls using Axios

Manage user input and search functionality with useState

Implement conditional rendering and error handling

Store and display user-selected favorite movies

Design a mobile-responsive layout using modern UI techniques

The project serves as a real-world use case for building lightweight, API-driven frontend apps that deliver meaningful information with minimal dependencies.

üîë Key Features
üîç Movie Search
Users can type in the name of any movie, and the app fetches a list of matching titles from the OMDb API. The results are displayed in a grid format with movie posters, titles, and release years.

üé¨ Movie Details (Optional Extension)
Each movie card can be extended to show more detailed info such as:

Plot summary

Genre

Director

Ratings

(This feature is based on getMovieDetails by IMDb ID if implemented.)

‚ù§Ô∏è Save to Favorites
Users can "like" or "save" their favorite movies, which are then added to a Favorites section. This demonstrates:

State management across components

Use of props and event handlers

Optional persistence with local storage

‚ùå Error Handling
If a user searches for a movie that doesn‚Äôt exist or types an invalid query, a friendly error message is displayed such as:

"No movies found. Try searching something else."

This ensures the app does not break on invalid inputs.

üíª Responsive Design
The app is built using responsive CSS techniques, ensuring it looks and works great on:

Desktops

Tablets

Mobile devices

Cards resize and reflow according to screen size for a seamless user experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Used
Technology	Purpose
ReactJS	Building the user interface and components
Axios	Making HTTP requests to the OMDb API
OMDb API	External data source for movie info
CSS	Styling and responsive design
Vite / CRA	Fast development server (depending on setup)

üöÄ Learning Outcomes
Working on this app helped strengthen my understanding of:

Fetching and consuming RESTful APIs with Axios

Managing state using React‚Äôs useState and props

Handling asynchronous operations and async/await

Building reusable and modular components

Displaying lists dynamically using .map()

Implementing clean and minimal UI/UX with responsive design

Conditional rendering based on API responses

Local storage (if implemented for favorites)

üåê Possible Future Enhancements
Add pagination for longer movie result lists

Display detailed movie info in a popup or separate page

Use local storage to persist favorite movies across sessions

Add loading spinners while API calls are in progress

Filter results by genre, year, or type (movie/series)

This project not only reinforces the basics of working with APIs and React components but also lays a strong foundation for building more advanced applications like streaming platforms, recommendation systems, or entertainment dashboards.
